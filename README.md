Morse Code Karaoke - Berlin Geekettes Hackathon 2013

* Claudine Chen @mingness
  code and ASCII art
* Federica Teodori @eotchi
  sound engineering
* Samantha Bail @spbail
  code

To run: install dependencies
- morse
- pyfiglet
- numpy
- pygame

(maybe some others) using pip or downloads from the websites. Google...

Then run python2.7-32 main.py main.py in your terminal - it needs to run with the 32 bit version

It only works with the demo song at the moment, but we're considering turning it into a proper app using existing web services. Whoop!
