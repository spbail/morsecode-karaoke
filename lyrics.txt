Like the legend of the phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning (uh)
The force of love beginning

(Look)

We've come too far to give up who we are
So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars

She's up all night 'til the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky
